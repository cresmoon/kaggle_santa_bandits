# Agents for Kaggle Santa 2020 (The Candy Cane Contest)

Implementations of some agents for the [Kaggle Santa 2020 Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-2020/). Unfortunately they did not do well on the leaderboard; based on the winning strategy discussions I think it was because I did not take into account *how* the opponent plays the game, i.e., these agents were developed from the bandit setting point of view, not the game setting point of view.
